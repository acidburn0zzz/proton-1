# Installation

Proton requires that you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed. It may be easiest to then install proton globally on your computer. You can do this with the following command.

```sh
composer global require foundation/proton
```

Make sure that you add the composer global installation folder to your shell PATH. By default it should be in the following location: `~/.composer/vendor/bin`
