# Generating a Sitemap

By default, Proton will generate a `sitemap.xml` file for SEO. You can turn off this feature by setting the `sitemap` option in the config file to `false`.

One important setting that you will need to make sure that you set is the `domain` setting. This setting should contain the root URL of your website. For example: `https://www.example.com`.
