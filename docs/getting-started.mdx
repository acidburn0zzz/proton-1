# Getting Started

You can see an example of how to setup proton in the [sample folder](https://github.com/foundation/proton/tree/master/sample). You can also create a [proton.yml](https://github.com/foundation/proton/blob/master/proton.yml) configuration file.

You can use the following command to create the default structure needed for proton. You can optionally add the `--config` option to generate a config file as well.

```sh
$ proton init --config
```

Then you can run the following command to build your site.

```sh
$ proton build
```
