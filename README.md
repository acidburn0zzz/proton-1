# Proton - CLI Tool for compiling web pages and email

Just like an actual proton is only one part of an atom, Proton is just one piece of the core for your project. It is not intended to be a full fledged CMS. It does zero management of your JavaScript, CSS, Assets or any kind of API that you website may require. Proton can compile your webpage assets into HTML, PHP or whatever language you may require.

This project is meant to replace the popular [panini](https://github.com/foundation/panini) site generator.

```
This project is in very early stages. Any feedback would be appreciated.

PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS FOR PRODUCTION PROJECTS.
